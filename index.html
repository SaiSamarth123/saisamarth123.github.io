  <b>Description</b>
  <br>
  <p>This project was an individual project focused on Augmented Reality. The goal of this project was to make two AR knickknacks. These knickknacks grab the weather and time at the location of the attraction they represent. I picked Charminar(Hyderabad, India) and Starbase(Texas) as the two knickknacks for this project. They show the right temperature and time from the respective location. You can interact with the attractions and see what theyâ€™d look like from close. To see the two attractions, we need first to create two physical cubes so the application can map the AR knickknack onto them. We need the Merge cube for the Starbase knickknack, and for the Charminar knickknack, we need the Class cube.

    Downloading instructions:
  </b>
  <p>
    After building the physical cubes, download the project from the GitHub link above. Clone the project into a directory and open it in Unity. This project uses Unity 2021.3.6f1 and Vuforia version 10.9, so check the setting on Unity before running it. If you don't have Unity or Vuforia, go to https://unity.com/ and click the big blue Get Started button at the top, click on the Individual tab, and then click the blue Get Started button under Personal. Then download Unity Hub for your platform (Windows or Mac).
    For Vuforia, register for a free account at  https://developer.vuforia.com/. Download add-vuforia-package-10-9-3.unitypackage after clicking 'Add Vuforia Engine to a Unity Project or upgrade to the latest version.' Download the required version of Vuforia from https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/sdk. We need to add some backup files that Unity can recreate after downloading since we add a gitignore page to avoid those files for github. Unity should do this automatically if the versions for Unity and Vuforia are correct.

  <b>Description</b>
  <br>
  <p>This project was an individual project focused on immersive Virtual Reality. The goal of this project was to make a kiosk for the new CS building being built on Taylor. This project will allow us to walk around and interact with kiosk at human scale. I chose to make a Jazz pop up shop for the kiosk. We'd need to use the Oculus Quest headset to be able walk around in this virtual space.

    Downloading instructions:
  </b>
  <p>
    To gain access to this kiosk, first download the project from the GitHub link above. Clone the project into a directory and open it in Unity. This project uses Unity 2021.3.6f1 and VRTK version 4, so check the setting on Unity before running it. VRTK handles the visuals in the headset and the interaction. 
    If you don't have Unity or VRTK, go to https://unity.com/ and click the big blue Get Started button at the top, click on the Individual tab, and then click the blue Get Started button under Personal. Then download Unity Hub for your platform (Windows or Mac).
    We need to add some backup files that Unity can recreate after downloading since we add a gitignore page to avoid those files for github. Unity should do this automatically if the versions are correct. We can use both our device simulator and the headset to run this project.

  <b>Description</b>
  <br>
  <p>This project is an immersive Virtual Reality experience at building scale. The goal of this project is to enable users to walk around and interact with the things in the atrium of unbuilt CDRLC building. I decided to go with the world theme for my atrium. Each floor of the building is assigned a different continent. The ground floor of the building has North American items and theme. The first floor has the European theme. The second floor has the Asian theme. The third floor of the building has the South American theme. The last floor has African artifacts.

    Downloading instructions:
  </b>
  <p>
    To gain access to the atrium of CDRLC building, first download the project from the GitHub link above. Clone the project into a directory and open it in Unity. This project uses Unity 2021.3.6f1 and VRTK version 4, so check the setting on Unity before running it. VRTK handles the visuals in the headset and the interaction. If you don't have Unity or VRTK, go to https://unity.com/ and click the big blue Get Started button at the top, click on the Individual tab, and then click the blue Get Started button under Personal. Then download Unity Hub for your platform (Windows or Mac).We need to add some backup files that Unity can recreate after downloading since we add a gitignore page to avoid those files for github. Unity should do this automatically if the versions are correct. We can use both our device simulator and the headset to run this project. The CoffeeScene has the atrium. When you play the scene you should be able to move around with the WASD keys, use the mouse to look around. You can use the 2 key and 3 key to take control of the simulated left and right hand controls respectively. If you place one of the two simulated controllers into one of the interactable items you can use the left mouse button to pick them up. The 1 key takes you back to controlling the player. If you plug in one of the Quest headsets in the classroom, switch the platform to Android, turn off the CameraRigs.SpatialSimulator and turn on the CameraRigs.UnityXRPluginFramework, you can build and run the same scene on the headset and move around with your body and interact with the real controllers using the trigger on either controller to grab interactable items. Putting your thumb on the right joystick brings up a teleporter and then pressing the joystick teleports you to that location. Pressing the Oculus button on the right controller will allow you to exit the application.

  <b>VR Tours</b>
  <br>
  <p>
   Virtual reality is making strides in several fields and real estate hasnâ€™t been lefot out this loop. Real estate can benefit a lot by incorporating virtual reality into selling and advertising houses. It would enable real estate agents and homeowners to have 24/7 open house tours. The whole process would be made more simpler with the introduction of virtual reality tours of buildings and homes before theyâ€™re built or bought. It would deliver life-like tours that make users feel like theyâ€™re present at the location. Although people must include photos in their listing, photos can sometimes be misleading. It also enables them to introduce the property to other interested parties around the world. It also makes it stand out as people would want to try out the new technology. There are several companies that are trying to help real estate agents. Some companies have also received a lot of awards. Transported is a company that is trying to create VR tours for homes. They have been featured in the Los Angeles Times, Fortune, Curbed and other well known establishments. The company also has two options to for creating the tours. One for tour creators and one for real estate agents. The development of ARKit and ArCore has made it possible for people without VR headsets to experience these tours. Agents can send mobile compatible links to people who want to tour the buildings. It also allows for stunning details and graphics with impressive colors. They benefit both the buyer and the seller. There have also been studies that showed that people are more likely to buy a house if they offer virtual tours. 
In my life I could use this to show my family building that they cannot visit. It can use it to show my current home to my family members in India who wonâ€™t be able to make it here. Itâ€™s simple enough to book a service. The company then comes in to scan the house which usually takes about an hour. We could then share the tours to anyone. These tours can be viewed on the Google Cardboard, Oculus Rift, Samsung Gear as well as mobile phones and web. We could also use this technology to visualize buildings before they are finished constructing. It would help us get an idea of what the area would look like. Weâ€™d be able to make changes and see the environment change to create the best building. They are very convenient and hassle free. These tours will also allow the users to standout. If we create a house tour we have a recorded memory of the house forever. People would be able to walk around a virtual representation of their house if it get sold or destroyed. The process of making the VR house tour is simple as well. There are several award winning applications that make the whole process simpler. Staging the rooms and picking the shots is the only part of the process that might take the longest time. This part of the process includes taking test shots, rearranging the room and finalizing the shot. Although it sounds like a tiring process, it really isnâ€™t. Weâ€™d be able to scan our houses or buildings in a couple of hours depending on the size. Itâ€™s impossible to not use this kind of technology in the real estate industry because of all of its benefits. Itâ€™s also very beneficial to everyone in general whoâ€™s trying to build a house or building. Hopefully, in the near future VR tours will become the norm for any kind of tours.

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality have seen impressive advancements in their field ever since Google's 2017 keynote. Google then announced it would focus more on developing VR/AR headsets and applications. As it was a new advancement, it changed how people interact with technology and AR/VR. The introduction of ARkit and Google Tango pushed people to experiment and create new applications and products. However, there's always a period before a new platform is discovered and implemented by developers. Active Theory is a creative digital production studio based in California that decided to make this platform simpler. They primarily specialize in building digital experiences like websites and applications that people love. They have several award-winning products, but World Brush is one of their first and standout applications. Active Theory is a company that likes finding creative ways to use technology, and as a result, its first AR offering, World Brush, was released in 2017. World Brush is an immersive AR experience that lets users paint the world for others to discover. It's a simple idea that merges the digital and physical worlds. Users can paint on natural-world objects only visible where they were created.</p>
  <br clear="left"/>
  <img src="pdfs/paint.jpeg" width="400" height="300" align="right" hspace="25" vspace="10"/> 
  <br>
  <h3>Why is it a good use of AR?</h3>
  <p>World Brush is a good use of AR because it takes complicated technology and makes it simple for users. It's also a new foray into the world of AR. Before working on this application, they primarily worked with WebGL. Since WebGL is a platform built on OpenGL, they created an application platform that allowed them to write JavaScript code and render graphics in OpenGL within an iOS or Android app while taking advantage of ARKit and ARCore. After developing their in-built environment, they started experimenting and exploring to create AR content from which World Brush was born. The made the coding aspect of the AR project simpler too. In 2016, Google released a similar product called the Tilt Brush. Tilt Brush found a decent amount of success as it won several awards and was used by news channels. However, Google ended up releasing the application's source code on Github in 2021. It allows people to develop new ideas and improvements for the application. Although Active Theory didn't publish World Brush's source code online, they made the application available on iOS, which made it easier for the commoner to enter the field of AR.</p>
  <br clear="right"/>
  <img src="pdfs/brush.jpeg" width="230" height="350" align="left" hspace="25" vspace="10"/>
  <br>
  <h3>Who are its intended users?</h3>
  <p>They wanted to make the application usable by anyone, regardless of their experience with AR. They decided to make it a simplified tool without overwhelming the user with options. It's simple enough for anyone to jump in and begin painting. From the first launch, users can draw a line on their screen and see it appear in front of them. Users can unlock more brushes and change the colour and thickness as they keep using the application. Users can also like/dislike paintings to hide horrible stuff and showcase the good ones. This experience is similar to what Pokemon Go achieved when it was released in 2016. However, it was more immersive as it lets users physically draw and paint on natural-world objects. By using a drawing mechanism, they made this tool capable of crossing language barriers and can make every user's experience unique. We can easily picture people walking around in the city, parks, beaches, grocery stores etc. and see visual art appear in front of them. Anyone with a phone could access the application and begin drawing. It doesn't require the expensive headsets or tools that a complicated AR/VR application would require. By doing this, they ensured that the application was accessible and usable by anyone.</p>

  <br>
  <h3>What are positives and negatives about it?</h3>
  <p>One positive aspect of World Brush is that most of the code was in JavaScript, making it easier for developers to fix faults or improve the code. Using their previous experience, they created a new line rendering pipeline for their framework. They used ARKit and ARCore to track the data relative to the phone and render the painting in the orientation users drew. One of the negatives of this application is that a painting's location can appear to be offset by a few feet. They found this error during testing, but this margin of error was neglectable as GPS caused it. However, the painting is guaranteed to be facing the correct direction. They also made sure to optimize the application as much as they could. Each line the user draws is rendered as a separate mesh with unique geometry. Whenever a painting is saved or loaded, all the individual lines are merged to reduce the number of draw calls. By doing this, users can work on more extensive and intricate paintings. The merging, which includes heavy math calculations, happens on a background thread that temporarily prevents the main screen from freezing. The process of retrieving the paintings was further fastened when they started using Google's serverless cloud functions with their server framework. It enabled them to fetch paintings in milliseconds. Since this application is meant for the use of everyone, some popular locations can end up with several paintings. To lower the number of paintings a user sees in an area, they implemented an algorithm that analyzes the popularity and time of the creation of the painting to provide users with the highest quality content. The data of the painting, like the GPS location and time of creation, is stored in Firebase, which made it easier for them to limit the number of pictures a user can see at a specific location.</p>
