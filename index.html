  <b>Description</b>
  <br>
  <p>This project was an individual project focused on Augmented Reality. The goal of this project was to make two AR knickknacks. These knickknacks grab the weather and time at the location of the attraction they represent. I picked Charminar(Hyderabad, India) and Starbase(Texas) as the two knickknacks for this project. They show the right temperature and time from the respective location. You can interact with the attractions and see what theyâ€™d look like from close. To see the two attractions, we need first to create two physical cubes so the application can map the AR knickknack onto them. We need the Merge cube for the Starbase knickknack, and for the Charminar knickknack, we need the Class cube.

    Downloading instructions:
  </b>
  <p>
    After building the physical cubes, download the project from the GitHub link above. Clone the project into a directory and open it in Unity. This project uses Unity 2021.3.6f1 and Vuforia version 10.9, so check the setting on Unity before running it. If you don't have Unity or Vuforia, go to https://unity.com/ and click the big blue Get Started button at the top, click on the Individual tab, and then click the blue Get Started button under Personal. Then download Unity Hub for your platform (Windows or Mac).
    For Vuforia, register for a free account at  https://developer.vuforia.com/. Download add-vuforia-package-10-9-3.unitypackage after clicking 'Add Vuforia Engine to a Unity Project or upgrade to the latest version.' Download the required version of Vuforia from https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/sdk. We need to add some backup files that Unity can recreate after downloading since we add a gitignore page to avoid those files for github. Unity should do this automatically if the versions for Unity and Vuforia are correct.

  <b>Description</b>
  <br>
  <p>This project was an individual project focused on immersive Virtual Reality. The goal of this project was to make a kiosk for the new CS building being built on Taylor. This project will allow us to walk around and interact with kiosk at human scale. I chose to make a Jazz pop up shop for the kiosk. We'd need to use the Oculus Quest headset to be able walk around in this virtual space.

  <p>
    To gain access to this kiosk, first download the project from the GitHub link above. Clone the project into a directory and open it in Unity. This project uses Unity 2021.3.6f1 and VRTK version 4, so check the setting on Unity before running it. VRTK handles the visuals in the headset and the interaction. 
    If you don't have Unity or VRTK, go to https://unity.com/ and click the big blue Get Started button at the top, click on the Individual tab, and then click the blue Get Started button under Personal. Then download Unity Hub for your platform (Windows or Mac).
    We need to add some backup files that Unity can recreate after downloading since we add a gitignore page to avoid those files for github. Unity should do this automatically if the versions are correct. We can use both our device simulator and the headset to run this project.

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality have seen impressive advancements in their field ever since Google's 2017 keynote. Google then announced it would focus more on developing VR/AR headsets and applications. As it was a new advancement, it changed how people interact with technology and AR/VR. The introduction of ARkit and Google Tango pushed people to experiment and create new applications and products. However, there's always a period before a new platform is discovered and implemented by developers. Active Theory is a creative digital production studio based in California that decided to make this platform simpler. They primarily specialize in building digital experiences like websites and applications that people love. They have several award-winning products, but World Brush is one of their first and standout applications. Active Theory is a company that likes finding creative ways to use technology, and as a result, its first AR offering, World Brush, was released in 2017. World Brush is an immersive AR experience that lets users paint the world for others to discover. It's a simple idea that merges the digital and physical worlds. Users can paint on natural-world objects only visible where they were created.</p>

  <h3>Why is it a good use of AR?</h3>
  <p>World Brush is a good use of AR because it takes complicated technology and makes it simple for users. It's also a new foray into the world of AR. Before working on this application, they primarily worked with WebGL. Since WebGL is a platform built on OpenGL, they created an application platform that allowed them to write JavaScript code and render graphics in OpenGL within an iOS or Android app while taking advantage of ARKit and ARCore. After developing their in-built environment, they started experimenting and exploring to create AR content from which World Brush was born. The made the coding aspect of the AR project simpler too. In 2016, Google released a similar product called the Tilt Brush. Tilt Brush found a decent amount of success as it won several awards and was used by news channels. However, Google ended up releasing the application's source code on Github in 2021. It allows people to develop new ideas and improvements for the application. Although Active Theory didn't publish World Brush's source code online, they made the application available on iOS, which made it easier for the commoner to enter the field of AR.</p>

  <h3>Who are its intended users?</h3>
  <p>They wanted to make the application usable by anyone, regardless of their experience with AR. They decided to make it a simplified tool without overwhelming the user with options. It's simple enough for anyone to jump in and begin painting. From the first launch, users can draw a line on their screen and see it appear in front of them. Users can unlock more brushes and change the colour and thickness as they keep using the application. Users can also like/dislike paintings to hide horrible stuff and showcase the good ones. This experience is similar to what Pokemon Go achieved when it was released in 2016. However, it was more immersive as it lets users physically draw and paint on natural-world objects. By using a drawing mechanism, they made this tool capable of crossing language barriers and can make every user's experience unique. We can easily picture people walking around in the city, parks, beaches, grocery stores etc. and see visual art appear in front of them. Anyone with a phone could access the application and begin drawing. It doesn't require the expensive headsets or tools that a complicated AR/VR application would require. By doing this, they ensured that the application was accessible and usable by anyone.</p>

  <h3>What are positives and negatives about it?</h3>
  <p>One positive aspect of World Brush is that most of the code was in JavaScript, making it easier for developers to fix faults or improve the code. Using their previous experience, they created a new line rendering pipeline for their framework. They used ARKit and ARCore to track the data relative to the phone and render the painting in the orientation users drew. One of the negatives of this application is that a painting's location can appear to be offset by a few feet. They found this error during testing, but this margin of error was neglectable as GPS caused it. However, the painting is guaranteed to be facing the correct direction. They also made sure to optimize the application as much as they could. Each line the user draws is rendered as a separate mesh with unique geometry. Whenever a painting is saved or loaded, all the individual lines are merged to reduce the number of draw calls. By doing this, users can work on more extensive and intricate paintings. The merging, which includes heavy math calculations, happens on a background thread that temporarily prevents the main screen from freezing. The process of retrieving the paintings was further fastened when they started using Google's serverless cloud functions with their server framework. It enabled them to fetch paintings in milliseconds. Since this application is meant for the use of everyone, some popular locations can end up with several paintings. To lower the number of paintings a user sees in an area, they implemented an algorithm that analyzes the popularity and time of the creation of the painting to provide users with the highest quality content. The data of the painting, like the GPS location and time of creation, is stored in Firebase, which made it easier for them to limit the number of pictures a user can see at a specific location.</p>
